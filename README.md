# Arduino_Mastermind-Game
I created this little game as a hobby for my children during the Covid-19 quarantine. I had already seen some versions for two players on the Internet. But I wanted a version in which the player would challenge Arduino itself, because then I could turn the game into a puzzle for Escape Room.
